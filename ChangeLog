1.3-1 (19 June 2008)
-----

added cleanup feature to allow interupts within C code
to blasso and bmonomvn

also fixed a bug involving reading in the traces of
bmonomvn regressions

RJ models start in 90% saturate model now, instead of
100% saturated

added the ability to specify starting mu, S and lambda
values for bmonomvn (where appropriate)
	
now extracting lambda from lars and ridge methods for
use as starting values in bmonomvn

now providing estimats of the variance of the estimates
for S, via the output S.var

added batch option to monomvn function in order to 
force a regression for each column (when FALSE)
	

1.3 (9 June 2008)
---

added calculations of log posterior in blasso

added reversible jump (RJ) variable selection where
proposals come from "full updating" a la Brooks & Ehlers.
This directly effects the Bayesian Lasso -- adding a
new RJ option among others.  Of course, this method is
now available to the bmonomvn algorithm as well
	
added trace plots to plot.blasso for s2 and lambda2
in addition to new model order option "m" when RJ=TRUE

changed lamnda2 default prior setting from (r,d)=(1,1)
to (2,0.1) to avoid singular regressions when RJ is used
with the improper s2 prior with (a,b)=(0,0)

changed the way bmonomvn and blasso take many of its
hierarchical prior arguments


1.2 (8 May 2008)
---

fixed syntax errors in the documentation files and filled
out the INDEX file

Implemented Bayesian Lasso version resulting in a new 
function called bmonomvn.  A standalone interface to
the Bayesian Lasso is also provided via a blasso
function

added a symmetric option to kl.norm


1.1-4 (11 Nov 2007)
-----

fixed lambda recording bug in regress.ridge


1.1-3 (05 Nov 2007)
-----

added verb=2 and verb=3 arguments for printing each of
the ML regression estimators, and new mu entries and 
cols of S

removed verbose LGPL in DESCRIPTION


1.1-2 (31 Oct 2007)
-----

summary.monomvn now calculates the number of zeros in
the covariance matrix (& inv covar matrix) when using the
lasso method -- for summarizing pairwise marginal (and
conditional) independence

a new plot.summary.monomvn function makes histograms of
the numbers of zeros in each column of the covariance
matrix and its inverse

kl.norm now returns Inf with a warning if there is a 
truly non-positive definite matrix

increased minimum (m) number of observations in rmono


1.1-1 (21 Aug 2007)
-----

still having problems with the "forward.stagewise" 
method -- have emailed Hastie

added ridge regression with a silly heuristic on the lower
lower bound for lambda when p>n

added validation="Cp" for Mallows Cp method for choosing
the best lars model


1.1: (13 Aug 2007)
----

added lars package support for lasso, etc; ridge 
regression does not seem to work for the big-p small-n
problem

another special case in addy len(m1)=1, possibly due
to the s22.1 calculation that was modified in the last
version


1.0-3: (03 Aug 2007)
------

added url to DESCRIPTION and each relevant .Rd file

fixed verbosity/validation error in the call of regress 
from addy

simplified s22.1 calculation in addy to follow Stambaugh

fixed pls author last name

removed print(full) from rmono


1.0-2: (10 July 2007)
------

added validation argument to allow forcing of LOO

ab=NULL is now the default in rmono.R

cosmetic changes to documentation, particularly for 
monomvn

1.0-1: (11 June 2007)
------

error -> stop in posdef.approx
