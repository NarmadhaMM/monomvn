1.1: (13 Aug 2007)
----

added lars package support for lasso, etc; ridge 
regression does not seem to work for the big-p small-n
problem

another special case in addy len(m1)=1, possibly due
to the s22.1 calculation that was modified in the last
version


1.0-3: (03 Aug 2007)
------

added url to DESCRIPTION and each relevant .Rd file

fixed verbosity/validation error in the call of regress 
from addy

simplified s22.1 calculation in addy to follow Stambaugh

fixed pls author last name

removed print(full) from rmono


1.0-2: (10 July 2007)
------

added validation argument to allow forcing of LOO

ab=NULL is now the default in rmono.R

cosmetic changes to documentation, particularly for 
monomvn

1.0-1: (11 June 2007)
------

error -> stop in posdef.approx
